## 📧 EmailJS Configuration (Fix Email Routing)
If you are still receiving emails at your old address, you must update your **EmailJS Template**:

1. Log in to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/).
2. Go to **Email Templates** and select `template_zoxrq4d`.
3. In the **Settings** tab (or the "To Email" field), change the value to: `{{to_email}}`.
4. This allows the `script.js` to dynamically tell EmailJS to send the mail to `theuniquedawg29@gmail.com`.
5. Click **Save**.
